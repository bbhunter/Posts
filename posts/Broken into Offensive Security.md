# Broken Into Offensive Security

I feel a lot of advice about breaking into offensive security is broken. I also think that at this point the advice for breaking into security is different then the advice you give somebody hoping to break into offensive security. My advice has changed pretty drastically over the years and is based on my experience with breaking into offensive security myself with no degree, certifications, or on paper experience. Additionally this post is the result of me mentoring countless people.

## Types of broken advice

Broken advice comes in all types but some are particularly counter intuitive to the person receiving the advice. 

Here is a list of things I don't think you should do:

* Overwhelm people with a gigantic list of resources and books
* Forgetting to ask specifically which topic someone wants to focus on within offensive security
* Failing to find out what learning style and path works best for them
* Telling people to learn everything there is to know back to 199x

## Differences between security and offensive security

I believe at this point in the timeline of security careers it's particular important to separate the advice given to an individual wanting to break into security and offensive security. The necessary steps, skills, and motivations can be vastly different. Security is an extremely broad topic and offensive security applies specifically to breaking into computers, networks, and applications using hacking techniques in order to report the issues.

## Certifications, Education, Alphabet Soup

One of the first questions I get asked is whether or not certifications and/or degrees are necessary. The answer to "are they necessary?" is no with myself as proof. However it's more important to focus on the goal not the paper you receive. 

There're a wide range of goals in offensive security such as:

* Compromising computer systems, networks, and applications
* Bypassing security measures put in place to stop attackers
* Evading detections from software and active threat hunters
* Reaching objectives that are meaningful to the overall testing

You should think about the experiences you will have and how the certification, training, or education will help you reach your goals and obtain your desired job. 

Let's break down each one...

**Certifications**

These can be helpful when attempting to get past HR screening. In some job cases they are essential because only candidates with the certifications required will be considered for the position. It's necessary to understand the types of job that will require these certifications. There're however certifications that will provide you a valuable experience to go with the piece of paper and letters you receive. These types of certifications are few and far between. Most certifications will only teach you conceptual knowledge. An example of a certification that will give you practical hands-on skills is the OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional).

**Degree**

This can be similarly helpful in getting past HR screening and in some job cases essential. Understanding what types of jobs require a degree and determining whether or not these are the types of jobs you want will help you with this decision. More importantly you should focus on the skills you will receive while attaining a degree in for example computer science. I notice many people with this degree who have a decent understanding of computer programming.

**Alphabet Soup**

A person with a large number of certificates and qualifications after their name or in their social media bio. There is most definitely a way to achieve all of these certifications and still be very unqualified to work in offensive security. You should not focus on the amount of certifications and qualifications you have and instead focus on the amount of hands-on related skills you can bring to the job. Also frankly I've never met a person who both thought having all these certifications after their name was important and was an exceptionally good offensive security person...just saying.

The key take away here is to choose the combination of educational paths that will help you reach your goal. At the end of the day you will be the one required to have the skills necessary to succeed.

Below are a few scenarios with specific examples:

**Scenario 1 - Certification/s**

You have a few years of experience in operations (systems administration) and would like to transition to offensive security. You decide to take a certification like the OSCP that will give you the practical hands-on experience necessary to perform penetration testing. You will combine this with your many years of experience in networking and Active Directory.

**Scenario 2 - Degree**

You have no experience and want structured learning. You decide a degree in computer science will help you later decide what you want to specialize in and it will also provide you a solid background in programming. You're going to supplement with personal research about offensive security and do hands-on labs as you get your degree.

**Scenario 3 - None**

You do not like structured learning or classroom environments. However you have taught yourself how to do hackthebox challenges. You are willing to put in the effort to find a job that will except your style of learning. You decide that building personal projects and posting them publicly will demonstrate the skills necessary to get a job.

**Scenario 4 - Alphabet Soup**

You have decided that having as many letters after your name as possible is essential to your success. You take all the expensive practice tests and nail the multiple choice exams that are nothing like the actual work you will do in offensive security. You've done it <insert_name> CISSP, CISM, Security+, Network+...You know what throw "Security Expert" in there...you've earned it. You make sure your terminal has matrix green text and you can't figure out why everybody keeps calling you Joey...

## Dev, Ops, and no background

Dev vs Ops background seems to be the great divider in offensive security. Many people start doing this job with a dev background while others start with an operations (systems adminstration) background. It is also entirely possible to start with neither although in my opinion makes it much harder. Starting with no background leaves you grasping for straws with some of the most basic concepts. I find a much higher success rate with individuals who have been successful for a number of years at either Development or Operations. 

However I still think it's entirely possible to prepare yourself for a job in offensive security with no prior technical experience. I do however think it will be necessary to work a bit harder to both grasp basic technical concepts and apply them quickly to offensive security. I recommend spending at least the first 3-6 months building a foundation in the technical concepts necessary to achieve the goals of your planned study path. For example if you plan to be a network penetration tester you should spend this time familarizing yourself with networking concepts, protocols, and setting up networks.

## Meetups and Conferences

I can't ever leave out meetups because I got my first job on a Red Team by meeting my previous boss at a meetup. Also attending conferences has allowed me to meet many interesting people. At first I highly recommended going to conferences and now I tend to believe that I learn very little from them. I admit this could be just me but I can't recommend this to be an essential part of your strategy. I will however say you should get out and meet people. You can certainly be much more successful than me at learning from conferences. My only advice is if you want to work in offensive security make sure you focus on the more technical conferences.

## Practical vs Conceptual

Balancing these two can be very important in the early stages of learning. You will fall short if you can perform hands-on tasks but get hindered by your lack of conceptual understanding. Even worse is having too much conceptual understanding but almost no time with your hands-on the keyboard. I have experienced people who can hack their way through networks but lack the ability to create a user in Active Directory. I also know people who can use Burp Suite to test the heck out of web apps but don't understand the 3 way TCP handshake. In my opinion it's best to dive right into the practical hands-on skills as soon as possible. Then when you get to the point where you're having trouble understanding the topic seek more of the conceptual understanding necessary to see the bigger picture. Repeat this process to expand on topics where you're confused or hindered by lack of understanding.

## Immersion

I don't hesitate to say this can be one of the most important parts of breaking into offensive security. Immersion is putting yourself in a position frequently to take in concepts, terms, and ideas related to the topic. This can be listening to podcasts, watching videos, and reading chat logs. Over time this will build up your understanding of the topic as you both affirm knowledge and get introduced to a diverse set of ideas about the topic.

## Specializing (What should I study?)

At this point it's far too overwhelming to expect a new person attempting to migrate into offensive security to learn everything from before they arrived. At one point probably up until 2008 this may have been possible if you furiously studied to catch up. I have started to see a number of individuals far more successful by picking single topics and sticking to it. Of course along the way it's still important to learn something outside of your area of expertise. If somebody asked me right now where to start I would say start looking at what you want to specialize in. This will help you avoid getting overwhelmed and enable you to review your options in bite sized pieces you can reasonably handle.

## Personal brand, Projects, Blog, and Social Media

Once you have made the decision to break into offensive security you may ask "is it necessary to have a public profile?". You probably see others with Twitter accounts that have 50k followers and think well this must be the way. 

Let's break this down...

I do agree it is advantageous to work on your personal brand. However it's not necessary. My advice would be have fun if you choose to do this. If you want a hacker alias with a neat bio picture by all means do it. I will however say you should always be yourself. if this isn't your thing just don't do it.

Projects are a great way for you to display your abilities. For example having Github projects shows you know how to use Github while also displaying your ability to program in one or many languages. Posting on a blog can show you have technical writing skills and display your ability to do a wide variety of things related to offensive security. These are great for interviews and separate you from other candidates in regards to level of passion for offensive security.

You don't need to have social media to break into offensive security. Some of the best offensive security people I know avoid it completely. If you decide to do social media I recommend you seek genuine interactions and not followers. Share what you're interested in and steer clear of the drama if possible. You can make some great friends by being active on platforms such as Twitter. This can also however be a huge distraction to your goals so keep it in check.

## Consulting vs Corporate

This is another one of the dividers I don't believe is talked about enough. These represent two very different types of jobs in offensive security. 

Let me break down some of the key differences:

**Consulting:**
* Tends to involve traveling
* You may be subject to working alone more frequently
* I have seen more research time in these roles
* Expected to create public content on behalf of the company
* Shorter time frames to get work done in some cases

**Corporate**
* Typically less travel
* Ability to work in teams more frequently
* Often asked to show "impact"
* Harder to publish public content on behalf of your company
* More direct/constant interaction with your customers

## Putting it all together

* Do you want to work in offensive security? If yes proceed
* Choose your educational path:
    * Take into consideration your background and years of experience
    * Make sure to always consider your goals
    * Always use the path you feel works best for your learning style
* Find local meetups or conferences in your area (Optional)
* Listen to podcasts, watch videos, or read chat logs daily for immersion
* Choose a speciality and give yourself 1-2 weeks on that topic to verify that you enjoy it
* Make sure your plan matches the type of job you're seeking
* Choose the level of public interaction that makes you comfortable
    * Projects are the highest priority
    * Have fun and be yourself on social media
    * Seek friends not followers
