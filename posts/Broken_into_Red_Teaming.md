# Broken Into Red Teaming

I feel a lot of advice about breaking into Red Teaming is broken. Based on my experiences, my advice has undergone significant changes over the years. I entered this industry without a degree, certifications, or on-paper experience. Additionally, this post is the result of my mentoring countless people.

## Types of broken advice

Broken advice comes in all forms, but some are more counterintuitive to the person receiving it. 

Here is a list of things I don't think you should do:

* Overwhelm people with a gigantic list of resources and books
* Forgetting to ask which topic someone wants to focus on within Red Teaming
* Failing to find out what learning style and path works best for them
* Telling people to learn everything there is to know back to 199x

## Differences between security, offensive security, and Red Teaming

At this point in the timeline of security careers, it's essential to separate the advice given to an individual wanting to break into security from that of offensive security and Red Teaming. The necessary steps, skills, and motivations can vary significantly. Security is a vast topic that spans across many domains. Offensive security is more specific, referring to the use of attacker tactics to perform security testing. Red Teaming, a subtopic of offensive security, involves specifically breaching servers and networks to achieve a specific objective.

## Certifications, Education, Alphabet Soup

One of the first questions I'm asked is whether certifications or degrees are necessary. The answer to "are they necessary?" is no, with myself as proof. However, focusing on the goal is more important than the paper you receive. 

There's a wide range of goals in Red Teaming, such as:

* Compromising computer systems, networks, and applications
* Bypassing security measures put in place to stop attackers
* Evading detections from software and active threat hunters
* Reaching objectives that are meaningful to the overall testing

It would be helpful to consider the experiences you will have and how the certification, training, or education will help you achieve your goals and secure your desired job. 

Let's break down each one.

**Certifications**

Many jobs require certification for the position. These can be helpful when attempting to get past HR screening. Understanding the types of jobs that will require these certifications is necessary. Only some certifications will provide valuable experiences to go along with the piece of paper and letters you receive after your name. These types of certificates are rare and scarce. Most certifications will only teach you conceptual knowledge. An example of a certification that provides practical, hands-on skills is the OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional).

**Degree**

Degrees can be similarly helpful in getting past HR screening and, in some job scenarios, required. Understanding what types of jobs require a degree and determining whether or not these are the types of jobs you want will help you with this decision. More importantly, it helps to focus on the skills you will receive while attaining a degree. An example of such a degree is a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. I have noticed that many individuals with this degree are skilled in computer programming.

**Alphabet Soup**

The term "Alphabet Soup" refers to a person with numerous certificates and qualifications listed after their name or in their social media bio. There is a way to achieve all these certifications while being unqualified to work in Red Teaming. It would be best if you focused on the skills you can bring to the job, rather than the number of credentials and qualifications you have. Also, I've never met someone who thought having all these certifications after their name was important and was an excellent Red Team candidate.

The critical takeaway is to select the combination of educational paths that will help you achieve your goal. You will be the one required to possess the necessary skills to succeed.

Below are a few scenarios with specific examples:

**Scenario 1 - Certification/s**

You have a few years of experience in operations (systems administration) and would like to transition to Red Teaming. You decide to pursue a certification like the OSCP, which will provide you with the practical, hands-on experience necessary to perform Red Teaming. You will combine this with your extensive experience in networking and Active Directory.

**Scenario 2 - Degree**

You need to gain experience and want structured learning. You decide that a degree in computer science will lead to discovering your specialty area, and it will also provide you with a solid background in programming. You will supplement your studies with personal research on Red Teaming and complete hands-on labs as you progress toward your degree.

**Scenario 3 - None**

You prefer not to engage in structured learning or classroom environments. However, you have taught yourself how to do HackTheBox challenges. You're willing to try to find a job that will accept your learning style. You decide that building personal projects and posting content publicly will demonstrate the skills necessary to get a job.

**Scenario 4 - Alphabet Soup**

You have decided that having as many letters after your name as possible is essential to your success. You take all the expensive practice tests and nail the multiple-choice exams that differ from the work you will do in Red Teaming. You've done it <insert_name> CISSP, CISM, Security+, Network+...You know what? Throw "Security Expert" in there...you've earned it. You make sure your terminal has matrix green text, and you can't figure out why everybody keeps calling you Joey.

## Dev, Ops, and no background

Dev vs. Ops background is the biggest differentiator in Red Teaming. Many people start doing this job with a dev background, while others begin with an operations (systems administration) background. I find a much higher success rate with individuals who have been successful for several years in either Development or Operations. It is also possible to start without experience, but it makes the journey much harder. Beginning with no knowledge leaves you grasping for straws when it comes to some of the most fundamental concepts. 

It's entirely possible to prepare yourself for a job in Red Teaming with no prior technical experience. However, working harder to grasp basic technical concepts and apply them quickly to Red Teaming will be necessary. I recommend spending the first 3-6 months building a foundation in the technical concepts required to achieve the goals of your planned study path. For example, if you plan to be a Red Team Operator, you should spend this time familiarizing yourself with operating systems, servers, and setting up networks.

## Meetups and Conferences

I can't ever leave out meetups because I got my first job on a Red Team by meeting my previous boss at a meetup. Additionally, attending conferences has enabled me to meet many interesting individuals. At first, I highly recommended going to conferences; now, I learn very little from them. My experiences are a factor here, but I can't recommend this as an essential part of your strategy. You should, however, get out and meet people. You can certainly be more successful than I am at learning from conferences. If you want to work in Red Teaming, focus on the more technical conferences.

## Practical vs. Conceptual

Balancing these two can be very important in the early stages of learning. You will fall short if you can perform hands-on tasks but need help with conceptual understanding. Even worse is having too much conceptual knowledge but not enough time to put it into practice with your hands on the keyboard. I have encountered individuals who can hack into networks, but need to learn how to create a user in Active Directory. I have also known people who can use Burp Suite to thoroughly test web apps, but need help understanding the three-way TCP handshake. It's best to dive into practical hands-on skills as soon as possible. When you reach the point where you're having trouble understanding the topic, seek more conceptual understanding to gain a broader perspective. Repeat this process to expand on topics you need clarification on or lack knowledge about.

## Immersion

Immersing yourself can be one of the essential parts of breaking into Red Teaming. Immersion involves frequently putting yourself in a position to absorb concepts, terms, and ideas related to the topic. You can achieve this by listening to podcasts, watching videos, and reading chats (IRC/Discord). Over time, this will build your understanding of the topic as you both affirm knowledge and are introduced to a diverse set of ideas about it.

## Specializing (What should I study?)

At this point, it's far too overwhelming to expect a new person attempting to migrate into Red Teaming to have all the historical knowledge. At one point, probably until 2008, this may have been possible if you studied furiously to catch up. I have seen many individuals achieve far more success by focusing on a single topic and sticking to it. Of course, along the way, it's still important to learn something outside of your area of expertise. If somebody asked me where to start, I would consider what you want to specialize in. Focusing on one topic will help you avoid getting overwhelmed and enable you to review your options in bite-sized pieces you can reasonably handle.

## Personal brand, Projects, Blog, and Social Media

Once you have decided to break into Red Teaming, you may ask, "Is it necessary to have a public profile?". You may see others with Twitter accounts with 50k followers and think that's important. 

Let's break this down.

It is advantageous to work on your brand. However, I don't think it's necessary. I suggest having fun if you choose to do this. If you want a hacker alias with a neat bio picture, by all means, do it. If this isn't your thing, don't do it. Last but not least, you should always be yourself.

Projects are an excellent way for you to display your abilities. For example, having GitHub projects demonstrates your proficiency in using GitHub, while also showcasing your ability to program in one or more languages. Posting on a blog can demonstrate your technical writing skills and showcase your ability to perform various tasks related to Red Teaming. These are great for interviews and help you stand out from other candidates in terms of your level of passion for Red Teaming.

You don't need to have social media to break into Red Teaming. Some of the best Red Teamers I know avoid it altogether. If you decide to use social media, I recommend seeking genuine interactions rather than just followers. Share what interests you and steer clear of the drama if possible. You can make great friends by being active on platforms like Twitter. However, participating in social media can be a huge distraction to your goals, so keep it in check.

## Consulting vs. Corporate

Consulting vs. Corporate is another one of the divisions I believe needs to be discussed more. These represent two very different types of jobs in Red Teaming. 

Let me break down some of the key differences:

**Consulting:**
* Tends to involve traveling
* You may be subject to working alone more frequently
* I have seen more research time in these roles
* Expected to create public content on behalf of the company
* Shorter time frames to get work done in some cases

**Corporate**
* Typically, less travel
* Ability to work in teams more frequently
* Often asked to show "impact."
* Harder to publish public content on behalf of your company
* More direct/constant interaction with your customers

## Putting it all together

* Do you want to work in Red Teaming? If yes proceed
* Choose your educational path:
    * Take into consideration your background and years of experience
    * Make sure to always consider your goals
    * Always use the path you feel works best for your learning style
* Find local meetups or conferences in your area (Optional)
* Listen to podcasts, watch videos, or read chat logs daily for immersion
* Choose a specialty and give yourself 1-2 weeks on that topic to verify that you enjoy it
* Make sure your plan matches the type of job you're seeking
* Choose the level of public interaction that makes you comfortable
    * Projects are the highest priority
    * Have fun and be yourself on social media
    * Seek friends, not followers
