# Privilege Escalation in your Offensive Security Career

If you go to any search engine and type in "breaking into offensive security" or "how to get started in offensive security" you will find pages and pages of results. however you almost never see articles about improving your skills once you are employed in Offensive Security. For me I felt that I was stuck at intermediate for many years. I wasn't a bad penetration tester but I was lacking some habits and direction that would allow me to advance any further. Over the past couple of years I've learned some techniques that have greatly improved my personal and professional development. These can also help you balance your life, avoid burnout, and overall get more done in less time.

## Scope limiting

There was a time where I would read any content that contained even one of a long list of words related to offensive security. This became a damaging habit as offensive security became a vast and extensive topic. I utimately realized that I was consuming a never ending list of content while also simultaneously hoarding information I would never use. Bottom line is 90% of what I read was mentally thrown out before I had a chance to use it. I was esentially operating in a FIFO (First in First out) pattern that wasn't helping me get any better. This was a bad habit linked to the fact that no penetetration tester ever wants to miss an issue. Therefore constant consumption of new techniques must be the answer right? Wrong I discoverd this was a bad and truly pointless habit. Limiting the scope of what I consumed through blog posts, videos, and Twitter turned out to be the fix.

* 90% of what you consume gets mentally thrown out
* Avoid getting side tracked by offensive security words
* Understand your brain buffer (First in First Out)

## Study to meet objectives...or for pure interest

After limiting scope to topics that I was either actively engaged in or ones needing improvment I realized I still lacked direction. It's very important to understand the reason why you're studying a topic. Are you meeting an objective? or just constantly consuming without a goal? It's fine to learn about something for pure interest but to be a more skilled penetration tester it's likely that you will eventually have to be intentional about skills improvement. For me solving this problem occured when I created a study board for myself where each item measures to an objective I'm trying to achieve. Sure I still get sidetracked by really interesting topics but by making sure at least 80% of your studying has an objective in mind you can improve significantly faster.

* Plan for objectives not every possible scenario
* Don't prepare for nothing
* You can also study topics that interest you

## Focus on 1 maybe 2 areas of related focus

Admittedly this was a very hard thing to achieve because I was very much and still am a generalist. This is the direct result of systems administration type work where you're required to know a little bit about a lot of things. However as time went on a started to realize the downfall of context switching non stop. I ultimately found that 2 - 4 weeks on the same topic allowed me to get the depth I needed. This also allowed me to do the hands on activies required to solidify and document the knowledge. Once I got this process down I was able to pick up a secondary topics and long as they were related. I'm still exploring how far I can take this process but I've seen significant improvement in retaining knowledge and applying to my everyday work.

* Focus on the same topic for at least 2 - 4 weeks
* Avoid rapid context switching

## Balance to avoid burnout

Originally my way of doing practically all studying was constant and unorganized. I was worried I couldn't get enough done if I wasn't switched on all the time. However I began to notice that if I was able to spend a short amount of dedicated time per week on a topic I would become much more proficient. I began to plan my work for only a few times and work and discovered I was more effective then I was when constantly in study mode. How is this possible? because I was able to let my mind rest during the times I wasn't focused and had a clear understanding of my goals when I did plan to study. I was also able to plan extended breaks without the constant anxiety of going back to my never ending work study.

* plan work
* plan breaks etc

## Be X person and let others be Y person

In the past few years offensive security has truly grown. It's no longer feasible to be knowledgeable in every topic. It's perfectly fine to be the go to person for one topic and let another person be the go to person for another topic. This was truly difficult for me to learn. However the more advanced your team becomes the more clear this fact shows. If you want to advance your career you will have be proficient in at least one topic. The one person army mentality can become a big hinderence later in career as you discover you're pretty knowledgeable on a lot of topics but not enough to be realied upon 100% for all support in that area.

* Let go of the "one person army" mentality

## Follow your own path

It can be very easy to look at all the awesome research you see online and believe that cumulatively this is how your career has to go. This was a limiting mindset for me early on. I tried many times to fit into the mold set forth by the offensive security community but I kept falling short as others paths didn't generate the same passion for me. I truly discovered the motivation and fulfillment I wanted when I decided what I was going to bring to the offensive security field.

* Follow your own path in study

## Embrace where you're right now

There was a time when I had a very strong opinion about what I thought I should be doing as a Red Teamer. This caused me to neglect the opportunties I had to leverage what was right in front of me for learning purposes. Frequently while employed we have access to technologies, training, and people that will make us much more well rounded and in turn better penetration testers. If we fight to hard to meet the ideal vision of the goals we set for ourselves we might miss these opportunities. My advice is to fully embrace the learning opportunites right in front of you. Don't let the idea of your perfect job hold you back from learning everything you possibly can from the current role you're in.

* Leverage what's in front of you

## Formal vs informal study

I have always been a very informal studier. Evertime I wanted to learn a new topic I searched the internet for every blog post, video, and Tweet I felt would help me. I completely underestimated the value of taking a course or reading a book. For a small cost I could save myself many hours of collection time. I also found this allowed me to plan studying much easier as the information was measured and ordered. You should always balance the positive and negatives of each but in most cases I'm starting to find that with a busy schedule seeking formal content is much more suited for improving myself.

* Having everything collected in one place (formal)
* Collecting the data on your own (Informal)
